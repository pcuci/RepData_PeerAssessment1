## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
activity <- read.csv("./activity.zip")
```

```
## Warning in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote =
## quote, : line 1 appears to contain embedded nulls

```

```r
str(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
